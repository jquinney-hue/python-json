    "Question": "1. A program needs to store the age of a user, for example 15.\n\n(a) State a suitable data type for the variable `age`.\n(b) Explain why this data type is appropriate for storing an age.",
    "Answer": "(a) A suitable data type is **integer**.\n\n(b) An age is always a whole number and does not require decimal places. An integer data type stores whole numbers efficiently, making it appropriate for this use.",
    "Explanation": "To solve this, you must first understand what kind of value an age is. Ages (0, 1, 2, …) are **whole numbers** with no decimal part. In programming, the **integer** data type is designed specifically for whole-number storage.\n\nOther types, such as real/float, allow decimal places, which are unnecessary here and would waste memory. Strings store text, which is also inappropriate because you couldn’t perform arithmetic like `age + 1`.\n\nTherefore, since ages are whole numbers and may be used in calculations, the **integer** data type is the correct choice."

    "Question": "2. A student writes the following line of pseudocode:\n\nOUTPUT \"Enter your name\"\n\n(a) Identify what is meant by the term **output**.\n(b) State one output device that could display this message.",
    "Answer": "(a) Output means sending information from the computer **to the user**.\n(b) A suitable output device is a **monitor**.",
    "Explanation": "In programming, **output** refers to any data that the computer sends outward so that the user can see or hear it. Output can appear through:\n- A monitor (text or graphics)\n- Speakers (sound)\n- A printer (printed output)\n\nIn this question, the pseudocode `OUTPUT \"Enter your name\"` instructs the computer to display this text to the user, usually on a **monitor**, which is the most common device used to show text."

    "Question": "3. A variable `valid` is used in a program and can only ever hold the values TRUE or FALSE.\n\n(a) State the most appropriate data type for `valid`.\n(b) Explain why this is the most appropriate data type.",
    "Answer": "(a) The most appropriate data type is **Boolean**.\n\n(b) A Boolean data type stores only TRUE or FALSE, which matches the intended use of the `valid` variable.",
    "Explanation": "Boolean is the correct data type whenever a variable needs to represent a simple **yes/no** or **true/false** condition.\n\nA Boolean variable can store exactly two values:\n- TRUE\n- FALSE\n\nThis prevents the programmer from accidentally storing inappropriate data (e.g. numbers or text). Since the variable `valid` is being used as a flag to indicate validity, Boolean is the most suitable choice."

    "Answer": "(a) \"Hello\" will be output **3 times**.\n\n(b) Step-by-step:\n- Start: count = 0 → 0 < 3 is TRUE → output once → count becomes 1.\n- Next: 1 < 3 is TRUE → output again → count becomes 2.\n- Next: 2 < 3 is TRUE → output again → count becomes 3.\n- Next: 3 < 3 is FALSE → loop stops.",
    "Explanation": "The WHILE loop repeats **as long as** the condition `count < 3` is TRUE.\n\nIteration breakdown:\n1. `count = 0` → 0 < 3 → output \"Hello\" → count = 1\n2. `count = 1` → 1 < 3 → output \"Hello\" → count = 2\n3. `count = 2` → 2 < 3 → output \"Hello\" → count = 3\n4. `count = 3` → 3 < 3 → FALSE → loop ends\n\nSince the body of the loop executed three times, \"Hello\" appears three times."

    "Answer": "(a) Pass\n(b) Fail\n(c) The IF statement checks whether `mark >= 50`. If the condition is TRUE it outputs Pass; if FALSE it goes to the ELSE part and outputs Fail.",
    "Explanation": "The IF statement contains a **Boolean condition**: `mark >= 50`.\n\nWhen the user enters 72:\n- 72 ≥ 50 is TRUE → program outputs **Pass**.\n\nWhen the user enters 34:\n- 34 ≥ 50 is FALSE → program follows the ELSE branch → outputs **Fail**.\n\nThe IF statement works by evaluating the expression `mark >= 50`.\n- If TRUE → THEN block runs.\n- If FALSE → ELSE block runs.\n\nOnly one branch can run, ensuring the correct message is shown based on the user's mark."

    "Question": "6. A student writes this pseudocode to calculate the sum of the first 5 positive integers:\n\ntotal ← 0\nFOR i ← 1 TO 5\n    total ← total + i\nNEXT i\nOUTPUT total\n\n(a) State the final value of `total`.\n(b) Show, step by step, how `total` changes during the loop.",
    "Answer": "(a) 15\n\n(b) Step-by-step:\n- Start: total = 0\n- i = 1 → total = 0 + 1 = 1\n- i = 2 → total = 1 + 2 = 3\n- i = 3 → total = 3 + 3 = 6\n- i = 4 → total = 6 + 4 = 10\n- i = 5 → total = 10 + 5 = 15",
    "Explanation": "The FOR loop runs from 1 to 5, adding each value of i to `total`.\n- It begins with total = 0.\n- Each loop iteration increases total by the current value of i.\n- After 5 iterations the values added are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nAdding these gives 15, which is the final total."

    "Question": "7. A program stores a user's password in the variable `password` as a string.\n\n(a) Explain why a string data type is suitable for storing passwords.\n(b) Give one reason why storing a password as an integer would NOT be suitable.",
    "Answer": "(a) A string can store letters, digits, and symbols – all of which may appear in a password.\n(b) An integer can only store digits, so it cannot store letters or special characters that many passwords require.",
    "Explanation": "Passwords commonly include a mix of characters, such as letters (A–Z), digits, and symbols (!, ?, %, etc.). The **string** data type is designed to hold sequences of characters, so it can store any valid password.\n\nAn **integer** only stores whole numbers. This means:\n- It cannot store letters.\n- It cannot store symbols.\n- It would remove leading zeros (e.g., ‘0123’ becomes ‘123’).\n\nTherefore, integers are not suitable for storing passwords."

    "Question": "8. A variable `score` holds the value 10. The following pseudocode is executed:\n\nscore ← score + 5\nscore ← score * 2\n\n(a) State the final value of `score`.\n(b) Explain each step used to calculate this final value.",
    "Answer": "(a) 30\n\n(b) Steps:\n- Start with score = 10\n- First line: score = 10 + 5 = 15\n- Second line: score = 15 * 2 = 30",
    "Explanation": "The value of `score` is updated **in sequence**, with each line using the new value from the previous step.\n1. Begin with score = 10.\n2. The statement `score ← score + 5` adds 5, giving score = 15.\n3. The next statement multiplies the new score by 2, giving 30.\nTherefore, after both updates, the final value is 30."

    "Answer": "name ← INPUT(\"Enter your name: \")\nOUTPUT \"Hello \" + name",
    "Explanation": "The program needs to:\n1. Prompt the user to enter their name.\n2. Store whatever they type in a variable.\n3. Display a greeting using that stored value.\n\n`INPUT()` reads text from the user.\n`OUTPUT` displays the greeting by joining (concatenating) \"Hello \" with the variable `name`."

    "Question": "10. In a quiz program, a variable `lives` stores how many chances the player has left. It starts at 3:\n\nlives ← 3\nlives ← lives - 1\n\n(a) State the new value of `lives`.\n(b) Explain why subtracting 1 from `lives` is useful in a game.",
    "Answer": "(a) 2\n(b) Subtracting 1 reduces the player's remaining chances whenever they make a mistake. When lives reach 0, the game can end.",
    "Explanation": "Games often track how many attempts a player has left using a counter variable. Starting at 3 means the player has three chances. Each mistake reduces this by 1.\n\n`lives ← lives - 1` means:\n- Take the current value (3), subtract 1, and store the result (2).\n\nWhen lives eventually become 0, the game knows the player has run out of chances."

A program reads an integer `num` from the user and should output whether it is even or odd.\n\n(a) Complete the missing condition in the pseudocode:\n\nnum ← INPUT(\"Enter an integer: \")\nIF __________ THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Even\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Odd\"\nENDIF\n\n(b) Explain how your condition works.",
    "Answer": "(a) The condition is: num MOD 2 = 0\n\n(b) An even number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0. An odd number divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Therefore, if num MOD 2 = 0 is TRUE, the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd.",
    "Explanation": "The MOD operator returns the remainder after division. For example:\n- 8 MOD 2 = 0 (even)\n- 11 MOD 2 = 1 (odd)\n\nA number is even if dividing it by 2 leaves **no remainder**. Therefore, the expression `num MOD 2 = 0` will be TRUE only for even numbers. If the condition is FALSE, the ELSE part runs and the number is odd."

    "Answer": "(a) The algorithm starts by assuming num1 is the largest. It then compares num2 with largest and updates it if num2 is bigger. It repeats the comparison with num3. After both checks, largest holds the biggest value.\n\n(b) For inputs 5, 12, 9 the largest is 12.",
    "Explanation": "Step-by-step:\n1. largest ← num1 → 5\n2. Compare num2 (12) with largest (5). 12 > 5 so largest becomes 12.\n3. Compare num3 (9) with largest (12). 9 > 12 is FALSE so largest stays 12.\n4. Output 12.\n\nThe algorithm always checks each value and updates the largest whenever a bigger number is found."

    "Answer": "(a) Index 2.\n(b) Use a FOR loop from 0 to 4, outputting names[i] each iteration.",
    "Explanation": "Arrays store values in numbered positions called indices. In this case, \"Chen\" appears at names[2].\n\nTo output all names, we need to visit each index in order:\nFOR i ← 0 TO 4\n    OUTPUT names[i]\nNEXT i\n\nThis displays Ali, Beth, Chen, Deepa and Eli in order."

    "Answer": "(a) The average is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. There are 4 scores, so we divide total by 4.\n(b) Total = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100 → average = 100 / 4 = 25.",
    "Explanation": "An average (mean) is calculated using the formula:\n\naverage = (sum of values) ÷ (number of values)\n\nIn this program, total accumulates the four input scores. Since exactly four numbers are entered, dividing the final total by 4 gives the average.\n\nFor the specific example:\n- After input: total = 100\n- average = 100 / 4 = 25\nSo the output is 25."

    "Explanation": "A FOR loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. In this case, we do not know how many guesses the user will need, so a condition-controlled loop is required.\n\nA WHILE loop continues **as long as** the condition is TRUE. Here, it repeats while guess is not equal to secret. As soon as the user guesses correctly, the condition becomes FALSE and the loop ends."

    "Answer": "(a) Indices checked: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. In this case it will stop early at index 3 where the value 9 is found.\n(b) The search checks each element in order. It stops if it finds the value or reaches the end of the array.",
    "Explanation": "A linear search begins at the first element and moves forward one step at a time. For the given array:\n- Index 0 → 4   (not 9)\n- Index 1 → 8   (not 9)\n- Index 2 → 2   (not 9)\n- Index 3 → 9   (target found → stop)\n\nThe algorithm always stops when:\n1.

    "Answer": "(a) Binary search is much faster because it halves the search space each step.\n(b) The middle value can only be compared meaningfully if the order of values is known. Without sorting, the algorithm cannot decide which half to discard.",
    "Explanation": "Binary search repeatedly examines the middle element. If the target is smaller, it only needs to search the left half; if larger, only the right half. This removes half the remaining items at each step, making it very efficient.\n\nThis only works if the array is sorted. If the items are not in order, comparing to the middle element tells you nothing about which half may contain the target, so binary search becomes invalid."

Two loops would scan the array twice, doubling the number of comparisons. A single pass reduces overall operations and is faster for large arrays.",
    "Explanation": "The algorithm sets both minTemp and maxTemp to the first value so we have a valid starting point. During the loop, each temperature is compared against both variables:\n- If temps[i] is smaller than minTemp, update minTemp.\n- If temps[i] is larger than maxTemp, update maxTemp.\n\nSince each temperature is checked only once, this requires fewer comparisons than running two separate loops. For large datasets, halving the number of scans can greatly improve efficiency."

    "Answer": "(a) The loop runs from 0 to 10, but values[10] does not exist because the array ends at index 9. Accessing values[10] causes an out-of-bounds error.\n\n(b) Correct line:\nFOR i ← 0 TO 9",
    "Explanation": "The array values[0..9] has 10 elements, so the final valid index is 9. A loop that runs to 10 will attempt to access an element that isn't stored in memory for this array.\n\nChanging the loop to:\nFOR i ← 0 TO 9\nensures each valid index is processed exactly once without trying to read outside the array."

Each loop increments attempts, so once it reaches 3 the loop cannot run again. This guarantees no more than 3 inputs.",
    "Explanation": "The WHILE loop checks two conditions:\n- fewer than 3 attempts have been used\n- password has not yet been entered correctly\n\nEach time the loop repeats, attempts increases by 1. Once attempts equals 3, the condition attempts < 3 becomes FALSE and the loop stops, even if the user still hasn't succeeded. This ensures the limit is enforced reliably."

There is no need to check further values.",
    "Explanation": "The loop checks each possible divisor from 2 up to n−1. If n is divisible by any such number, it has more factors than 1 and itself, so it cannot be prime.\n\nBecause this single discovery proves n is composite, the algorithm returns FALSE immediately instead of wasting time checking the remaining values."

    "Explanation": "Bubble sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The largest value gradually moves to the end ('bubbles up').\n\nAfter the four comparisons in the first pass, the number 7 has moved to the final position.

    "Answer": "(a) Defensive design means planning for invalid input or misuse so the program remains safe and functional. Input should be checked before being accepted.\n\n(b) Example pseudocode:\nREPEAT\n    num ← INPUT(\"Enter a number between 1 and 10\")\nUNTIL num >= 1 AND num <= 10",
    "Explanation": "Defensive design ensures a program can cope with mistakes or unexpected input. Validation checks ensure only acceptable values are used. In the REPEAT loop, the user is continually prompted until they enter a number that satisfies the condition num >= 1 AND num <= 10."

    "Question": "30. A program stores the number of minutes each student spends revising per day for 7 days in mins[0..6]. It must:\n- calculate the total minutes\n- calculate the average\n- determine the day (index) with the maximum value\n\n(a) Write pseudocode to perform all tasks in a single loop.\n(b) Explain how the algorithm keeps track of both the total and the maximum.",
    "Answer": "(a) Example pseudocode:\ntotal ← 0\nmaxMinutes ← mins[0]\nmaxIndex ← 0\nFOR i ← 0 TO 6\n    total ← total + mins[i]\n    IF mins[i] > maxMinutes THEN\n        maxMinutes ← mins[i]\n        maxIndex ← i\n    ENDIF\nNEXT i\naverage ← total / 7\nOUTPUT total\nOUTPUT average\nOUTPUT maxIndex\n\n(b) total accumulates each day's minutes as the loop runs. maxMinutes and maxIndex store the largest value seen so far and the position where it occurred.",
    "Explanation": "The loop handles all tasks at once:\n- total adds each day's minutes.\n- maxMinutes stores the largest value encountered.\n- maxIndex stores the index where this value appears.\n\nEach iteration compares mins[i] with the current maxMinutes. If the new value is larger, both maxMinutes and maxIndex are updated. After the loop, total and average are calculated, and maxIndex identifies the day with the most revision."
